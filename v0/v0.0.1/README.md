# Tracking Daemon v0.0.1

This is the last version of the tracking daemon from the old 'tracking' repo.  Uses the 'VTGS Tracking Protocol' (VTP) which is a simple comma delimited ASCII format for comms between the client and the daemon.  This was originally called 'v2.1'.  Keeping a copy in this repo as a reference and modifying slightly to work with updated MD-01 Firmware.
